# Mental Stress Detection Using Biosensors

The **Mental Stress Detection Using Biosensors** project identifies and classifies stress levels by analyzing physiological signals collected from biosensors. The project leverages advanced machine learning and deep learning models such as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Graph Neural Networks (GNN),** and **Random Forest (RF)** to analyze biosensor data. It processes data from multiple sensors, including heart rate, GSR, and body temperature, to predict stress levels with high accuracy.
